Travel Website - Full Stack Project

# 🏝️ About the Project
### This is my first full-stack project with a higher level of complexity due to the backend communication using Java and PostgreSQL. The goal of this project is to create a travel website where users can explore different travel destinations, book trips, and manage their profiles.

#🚀 Technologies Used
### - This project was built using the following technologies:

## Frontend
### - Vite (for fast development and optimized builds)
### - React (for the user interface)
### - JavaScript (for interactive features)
### - HTML & CSS (for structure and styling)

## Backend
### - Java & Spring Boot (for the backend server and API handling)
### - PostgreSQL (for database management)

# ⚠️ Important Note
### - This project only runs locally. The backend is not hosted on a public server, so you need to set up the environment on your machine to run the application.
